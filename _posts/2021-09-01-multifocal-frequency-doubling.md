Multifocal Frequency Doubling

<!--more-->

Rosli et al.[^rosli2009multifocal] attempt to use low spatial and high temporal frequencies were used to induce the frequency doubling phenomenon for dichoptic stimulation. 

Each stimulus was an integer number of cycles of each frequency, and all the output frequencies, responses to each region were extracted by a fast Fourier transform. The first $(f_{i})$ and second harmonic $(f_{i} + f_{i})$ responses were detected. All possible **second-order interaction frequencies**, $f_{i} + f_{j}$ for $i \ne j$, were also potentially present in the recorded responses, as none of these frequencies overlapped. Hence all these potential interactions were independently measurable. Therefore all the stimuli and possible responses were exactly orthogonal and corresponded exactly to particular coefficients in the spectrum.

Results show that **monocular conditions had comparatively larger amplitudes than dichoptic conditions**, responses in the right monocular eye being the largest, and responses from the inner regions are comparatively larger than those from the outer regions. The responses were dominated by second harmonic responses, and some significant interaction frequencies were also observed. In the context of automated perimetry in glaucoma patients, while dichoptic viewing has a potential advantage over monocular viewing in terms of reduced testing time, that advantage could be nullified by binocular suppression [^meese2004low].
