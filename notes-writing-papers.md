From [Behnam Neyshabur](https://twitter.com/bneyshabur/status/1349225436153319429):
1. Make your paper look similar to a typical ML paper. I can't emphasize this enough. Figures and tables should follow a similar style to what is usually seen in ML. So is everything else including the abstract, introduction, phrases, organization, etc.
2. Write the paper assuming the audience has a very short attention span! Many ML reviewers want to get a sense of the main results of the paper in 5 min so spend plenty of time on the abstract, first figure and contribution section. First impression matters a lot!
3. Many reviewers love papers that have a combination of theory + experiments. If you are writing a theoretical paper, try to include some experiments and if you are writing an empirical paper, try to add a theoretical component.
4. Cite many papers! Try to do a good job in reviewing the relevant literature AND be generous by citing many papers and giving them credit for what they have done. That is, if you are not sure, it is safer to cite.
